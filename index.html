        <h2>How we met</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Josh and Allie met at a Halloween party put on by mutual friends. Josh was already there when Allie and her friends arrived. Although they didn’t talk much, Josh noticed Allie and was quite taken with her.
          </li>
          <li>
            A few weeks go by and Allie and her friend Jessica go to a Friendsgiving party. That night, Jessica meets the Mike of her dreams and they start dating soon afterwards. They quickly realize that they both have single friends that could be set up with one another. Mike and Jessica independently sell Josh and Allie on the idea, and a double-date is planned in late December.           </li>
          <li>
            <em>“We pulled up to Mike’s house and with every step, my nerves grew. Mike opened the door and Josh was standing behind him. He literally took my breath away; I was instantly attracted to him”.</em> – Allie
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>“I was very pleased and nervous to spend time with the cute, bright-eyed brunette in front of me.”</em> - Josh
          </li>
          <li>
            They had dinner at a Thai restaurant and then went out for Karaoke. Josh sang <em>Sittin’ on the Dock of the Bay</em> by Otis Redding and melted Allie’s heart.
          </li>
          <li>
            They returned to Mike’s house to end the night with some dancing video games. Just before Josh was heading out to leave, he handed Allie his phone and said, “Put your number in here.” She did, and so their journey together began.

      <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After dating for three years, living together for two, and some hints from Allie, Josh planned the proposal.
         </li>
          <li>
            Early on June 6th, 2015, Josh and Allie went for a hike on <a href="http://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Dog_Mountain_Hike" target="_blank">Dog Mountain</a>, which is on the Washington side of the Gorge. The trail was covered in a canopy of trees until thousands of wildflowers were revealed on the rolling hills near the top.           </li>
          <li>
            The hike came to an end on a large mound of grass where a handful of accomplished hikers taking a break. After settling in, Josh reached into their backpack to pull out a black ring box.
          </li>
          <li>
            He revealed the ring while on one knee and asked Allie to be his wife. She replied, “of course!”, and then Josh proclaimed, “People of the mountain, we just got engaged!”

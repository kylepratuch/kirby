        <h2>How we met</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In October of 2011, we attended a Halloween party in North Portland with some mutual friends. <span class="josh">I dressed up as a Scarecrow while she wore a cute gangster outfit.</span> We arrived at the party separately and only spoke briefly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="allie">A couple weeks later, my friend Jess & his friend Mike started noticing each other at an ugly sweater party.</span> By December, Mike and Jess were dating and encouraging us separately to come out on a double date. <span class="josh">I was game, while Facebook due diligence was more Allie’s cup of tea.</span> We both agreed to a meet on a Friday after work, right before Christmas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="allie">When I saw the non-scarecrow version of Josh, I was immediately drawn to him.</span> <span class="josh">I realized then that the gangster gal from the Halloween party was the cute, bright-eyed brunette standing in front of me and we ended up having an amazing night together.</span> We went for Thai food and connected on some lewd jokes and a fairly popular comedy group.
          </li>
          <li>
            A short way down the road was a bar and karaoke spot. <span class="josh">I was excited to sing and choose Sitting on the Dock of the Bay by Otis Redding.</span> <span class="allie">I nearly died; Josh locked eyes with me for almost the entire song. My cheeks hurt from smiling after the impromptu serenade.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Back at Mike’s place, we played some competitive dance video games and sat next to each other on the couch. <span class="allie">At the end of the night, Josh handed his phone to me and said, “Put your number in here.”</span> We became an official couple one month later.

      <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After dating for three years, living together for over two years, and many hints from Allie, Josh decided the time had come to propose. They had also purchased a home together three months prior; their 3 year financial bond anniversary is March 21st, 2018.
          </li>
          <li>
            Early on June 6th, 2015, Allie and Josh left Portland and drove to Dog Mountain for a weekend hike.
          </li>
          <li>
            It was late spring and the wildflowers were in full bloom. This jaunt is 3.5 miles each way, that 2,800 feet. By the time we reached the summit, it was lunch time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Josh, deceivingly, reached into the bag to gather lunch, but instead pulled out a ring. He was on one knee in an instant and asked, “Will you be my Wife?” To which Allie replied, “Of Course!”
          </li>
          <li>
            Josh yelled “People of the Mountain, We just got Engaged!” a few people clapped and we took pictures.
          </li>
          <li>
            While walking down the mountain we took photos of a bouquet of wildflowers someone had stuck above a tree branch. We also stole a walking stick.
